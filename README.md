# 🧭 A-R-D Nav: A* – RRT – DWA Path Planning System

**A-R-D Nav** is a modular 2D grid-based navigation system that demonstrates path planning using three powerful algorithms: **A\***, **Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)**, and **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)**. It supports both **static** and **dynamic** obstacles and visualizes optimal paths in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 2D Matrix Environment (Grid Map)
- 🧠 Multiple Planning Algorithms:
  - A\* Search (heuristic-based)
  - RRT (sampling-based)
  - DWA (local dynamic obstacle avoidance)
- 🚧 Handles **static** and **moving obstacles**
- 🗺️ Visual representation of map, obstacles, and paths
- 🎥 Video output of simulation
- 🖼️ Snapshot image results

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Overview

| Algorithm | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **A\*** | Graph-based search using heuristics | Best for known static environments |
| **RRT** | Sampling-based path planning | Good for high-dimensional or unknown spaces |
| **DWA** | Local planning with velocity sampling | Real-time dynamic obstacle avoidance |

These algorithms can be run individually or compared in a combined experiment setup.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/A-R-D-Nav.git
cd A-R-D-Nav
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 How to Run

Run any of the algorithms individually:

```bash
# A* Algorithm
python main.py --algo astar

# RRT Algorithm
python main.py --algo rrt

# DWA Algorithm
python main.py --algo dwa
```

You can also run comparative simulations or toggle dynamic/static obstacles:

```bash
python main.py --algo all --dynamic True
```

---

## 📊 Results

* A\* generates optimal and shortest paths in static grids.
* RRT performs better in complex maps but is non-optimal.
* DWA dynamically avoids moving obstacles with real-time updates.

---

## 📌 TODO / Future Work

* Add ROS integration for real-world robot navigation
* Expand to 3D mapping
* Train an RL-based local planner for adaptive pathfinding
